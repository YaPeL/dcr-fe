            Welcome to Degree Confluence Rebirth
        </h1>
        <h2>What is Degree Confluence Project?</h2>
        <p>The goal of the project is to visit each of the latitude and longitude integer degree intersections in the world, and to take pictures at each location.</p>
        <p>You can visit the old project <a target="_blank" href="https://confluence.org/">here</a></p>
        <h2>Why Rebirth?</h2>
        <p> If you visited the old site you can tell it's pretty ancient, my idea is to re make it using modern frameworks, and with incentives for people to hunt for those places! basically a pokemon go of latitud and longitud points! :) </p>
        <h2>What does the current app do?</h2>
        <p> This prototype consist of the most basic tool you need for hunting those places!, a compass that tell you nearby points to visit and their distance!</p>
